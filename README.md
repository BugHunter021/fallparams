## Full Guide
### Troubleshooting Installation and Execution
If you encounter problems installing and running Fallparams, ensure that the version of Go installed on your system is the latest. Additionally, verify that you have GCC installed.

### Start
To create a parameter wordlist suitable for the page you are working on, simply provide the page link to fallparams.

```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page"
```
If you have many URLs for which you want to create a parameter wordlist, save all your URLs in a file and then provide the file name to fallparams.
```bash
fallparams -u "/path/to/file.txt"
```
You can also save the entire HTTP packet to a file and use it as an input for the tool, ensuring that it sends the exact same headers, cookies, and other details in the requests.
```bash
fallparams -r "request.txt"
```

### Custom Header
The URLs you provide might require a specific header to open or may return a different response based on the header. For example, the user information change section on most sites requires an authentication cookie. Using the following method, you can set as many headers as needed for sending the requests.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/profile/edit" -H "Cookie: auth=token" -H "Role: Admin"
```

### Post Data
If your target responds differently when a POST request with a specific value is sent, you can execute the fallparams command using the following method:
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/path" -X POST -b "param=value" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

### Headless
Many modern websites utilize JavaScript to dynamically generate their DOM, leading to variations between HTTP responses and browser DOM. To bridge this disparity, employing the headless switch can be advantageous.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page" -headless
```

### More Parameters
One of the great features of fallparams is its ability to use [Katana](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/katana) to crawl the links provided as input, resulting in more links and eventually creating a comprehensive parameter wordlist.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page" -crawl
```

### Offline Mode
If you've already run Katana or any other tool and stored the answer or source pages in files, simply move all the files into one directory. Then provide the directory path to fallparams. In this case, fallparams itself will not send a request and will use the contents of your files.
```bash
fallparams -dir "/path/to/directory"
```

### Output
To enhance the quality of your parameter wordlist, it's crucial to filter out noisy or irrelevant words that may enter during creation. One effective way to achieve this is by setting a specific character limit for each parameter.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page" -max-length 30
```
You can also specify the minimum number of characters for each parameter.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page" -min-length 3
```
By default, the generated parameter wordlist is saved in the parameters.txt file. However, you can customize the name and path of the output file as needed.
```bash
fallparams -u "https://target.tld/page" -output "custom_name.txt"
```
